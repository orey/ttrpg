* TTRPG Stuff Repository

Welcome everyone in my TTRPG repository where I try to gather interesting stuff about TTRPG.

This repo is the 3rd one of the cycle:
- [[https://github.com/orey/jdr][github.com/orey/jdr]] : French repo with a lot of TTRPG stuff and translations (in French)
- [[https://github.com/orey/DandD][github.com/orey/DandD]] : A repo dedicated to D&D, especially very old stuff (0e and 1e).
