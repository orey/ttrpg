In the realm of Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs), psionic systems refer to the rules and mechanics governing the use of psychic or mental powers. These systems can vary significantly between different game universes. Here are some major psionic systems from popular TTRPGs:

### 1. **Dungeons & Dragons (D&D)**
   - **Edition Variations**: Different editions of D&D have handled psionics differently.
     - **3.5 Edition**: Introduced a comprehensive psionic system with its own classes (e.g., Psion, Psychic Warrior) and a separate power point system for managing psionic abilities.
     - **4th Edition**: Integrated psionics more closely with the core magic system, using power sources and encounter/daily powers.
     - **5th Edition**: Psionics are less formally defined, often represented through subclasses like the Mystic (from Unearthed Arcana) or the Aberrant Mind sorcerer.

### 2. **Pathfinder**
   - **First Edition**: Included psionic classes and mechanics similar to D&D 3.5, with power points and unique classes like the Psion and Psychic Warrior.
   - **Second Edition**: Psionics are less prominent but can be found in supplements and third-party materials.

### 3. **Shadowrun**
   - **Awakened Powers**: Psionics in Shadowrun are often referred to as "Awakened" abilities, including magic and adept powers. These are tied to the character's Essence and are fueled by the ambient mana of the Sixth World.
   - **Technomancers**: A unique form of psionics involving the manipulation of the Matrix (the virtual reality of the setting).

### 4. **GURPS (Generic Universal RolePlaying System)**
   - **Psionic Powers**: GURPS handles psionics through a flexible point-buy system, allowing players to customize their psionic abilities. The core rules and supplements like "GURPS Psionic Powers" provide a detailed framework.

### 5. **Traveller**
   - **Psionics**: In the Traveller universe, psionics are a rare and often feared ability. The rules for psionics vary by edition, but generally involve a separate skill system and unique talents.

### 6. **Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay**
   - **Psykers**: In the grimdark future of Warhammer 40,000, psykers wield powerful but dangerous psychic abilities. The rules for psykers involve managing psychic phenomena and the risk of perils from the Warp.

### 7. **Cyberpunk 2020/Cyberpunk Red**
   - **Netrunners**: While not strictly psionic, Netrunners in Cyberpunk use their mental abilities to navigate and manipulate the virtual world of the Net. This involves a unique set of skills and rules for hacking and cyber-combat.

### 8. **Starfinder**
   - **Mystic Class**: Starfinder, a science-fantasy RPG, includes the Mystic class, which uses a hybrid of psionic and magical abilities. The system is integrated with the core magic rules but has its unique flavor and mechanics.

### 9. **Numenera**
   - **Esoteries**: In Numenera, psionic-like abilities are often represented through Esoteries, which are part of the broader magical/technological system of the Ninth World.

### 10. **Mutants & Masterminds**
   - **Power System**: This superhero RPG uses a flexible point-buy system for powers, including psionic abilities. Players can create a wide range of mental powers using the core rules.

Each of these systems has its unique approach to psionics, reflecting the themes and mechanics of their respective universes. Whether through power points, skill checks, or integrated magic systems, psionics add a layer of complexity and depth to character abilities in TTRPGs.


## Psionics in D&D

In Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition (D&D 4e), psionics are integrated into the core mechanics of the game, using a system similar to the one used for magical powers. Here are the key mechanisms and features of psionics in D&D 4e:

### 1. **Power Sources**
   - **Psionic Power Source**: Psionics are treated as a distinct power source, alongside other sources like Arcane, Divine, Martial, and Primal. This means that psionic powers follow the same basic rules as other powers but have their unique themes and effects.

### 2. **Classes**
   - **Psionic Classes**: D&D 4e introduced several classes that draw their powers from the psionic power source. These include:
     - **Ardent**: A charismatic leader who uses psionic powers to inspire and support allies.
     - **Battlemind**: A martial character who uses psionic abilities to enhance combat prowess.
     - **Monk**: While not exclusively psionic, the Monk in 4e has a strong psionic flavor, using mental discipline to perform extraordinary feats.
     - **Psion**: A versatile psionic caster who can manipulate the minds of others and the environment.

### 3. **Power Mechanics**
   - **Power Types**: Psionic powers are categorized into different types, similar to other powers:
     - **At-Will Powers**: These can be used repeatedly without limitation.
     - **Encounter Powers**: These can be used once per encounter but recharge after a short rest.
     - **Daily Powers**: These are more powerful and can be used once per day.
     - **Utility Powers**: These provide various benefits and can be used in different situations.
   - **Power Descriptions**: Each power has a description that includes its name, type, keywords, range, targets, attack type, and effect.

### 4. **Augments**
   - **Augmentable Powers**: Some psionic powers can be augmented, allowing the character to spend additional power points to enhance the power's effect. This is a unique feature of psionic powers in 4e.
   - **Power Points**: Characters with augmentable powers have a pool of power points that they can spend to augment their powers. These points refresh after an extended rest.

### 5. **Keywords**
   - **Psionic Keyword**: Powers with the psionic keyword are specifically tied to the psionic power source and may interact with other psionic effects or creatures.
   - **Other Keywords**: Psionic powers may also have other keywords that describe their effects, such as "telepathy," "telekinesis," or "illusion."

### 6. **Implement**
   - **Psionic Focus**: Some psionic powers require the use of a psionic focus, which is a type of implement. This focus can be a physical item or a mental construct that the character uses to channel their psionic energy.

### 7. **Feats**
   - **Psionic Feats**: There are various feats that characters can take to enhance their psionic abilities. These feats can provide additional power points, improve the effectiveness of psionic powers, or grant other benefits.

### 8. **Paragon Paths and Epic Destinies**
   - **Advanced Options**: As characters advance in level, they can choose paragon paths and epic destinies that further specialize their psionic abilities. These options provide additional powers and features that build on the character's psionic themes.

In summary, D&D 4th Edition integrates psionics into its core mechanics by treating them as a distinct power source with unique classes, powers, and augmentation options. This approach allows psionic characters to be as versatile and powerful as their magical counterparts, while still maintaining a unique identity within the game.
