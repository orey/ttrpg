### Summary of "L'univers des Mega"

**Mega** is a French tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) where players take on the role of contemporary Earthlings recruited by the Galactic Messengers Guild for their exceptional abilities of Transit and Transfer. These individuals, known as Megas, serve as galactic agents undertaking various missions across the galaxy and parallel universes.

#### Key Features:
1. **Transit**: The ability to teleport between tetrahedral structures, allowing instant travel across vast distances, including different planets and parallel universes.
2. **Transfer**: The ability to take control of another sentient being by transferring one's mind into their body.
3. **Missions**: Megas often work for the Guild, the Galactic Assembly (a galactic "UN"), or other diverse clients. Their missions frequently involve preventing inter-dimensional catastrophes.
4. **Settings**: The game spans technologically advanced galactic empires, temporally displaced alternate Earths, and worlds where magic and psychic powers are common.
5. **Rarity**: Megas are so rare that they are often considered legendary. Their actions represent humanity to the galactic community.
6. **Training**: New Megas undergo training to acclimate to different planets, gravities, and technologies. They learn to use their Transit and Transfer abilities effectively and are indoctrinated into the Guild's moral code.
7. **Covert Operations**: The Guild uses various cover identities and companies to hide their activities on Earth.
8. **Diverse Origins**: Megas come from different races and planets, each with unique characteristics and cultures. Some races, like the Ilmaniens, are telepathic.

#### Notable Characters:
- **Major MacLambert**: The current Earth-based leader of the Guild, who has been in his position since 1890 and has extensive experience in managing Megas and their missions.

#### Mysteries:
- The origins of the various Talsanite races are shrouded in mystery, with fragmentary evidence suggesting ancient population transfers and possible manipulation by unknown entities.

### Translation of Key Sections

#### Presentation
In Mega, you embody a contemporary Earthling recruited by the Galactic Messengers Guild for your exceptional gifts of Transit and Transfer. You will become a Galactic Messenger or Mega. Transit allows the Mega to teleport between two tetrahedral structures, whether on the same planet, across the galaxy, or even in parallel universes! Transfer, on the other hand, allows the Mega to take control of a sentient creature by transferring their mind into the creature's body. The Mega is a kind of secret agent fulfilling countless missions, often in the service of the Guild itself, sometimes for the Galactic Assembly, a "UN" on the scale of the Milky Way, and even for various third parties. Often plunged into the meanders of parallel universes, they try to prevent inter-dimensional catastrophes.
- You evolve in a technologically very advanced galactic empire.
- You visit temporally displaced alternate Earths.
- You explore worlds where practicing magic and psychic powers is a way of life. Galactic Messengers can be sent on missions in any imaginable universe, no matter how strange! Mega is a bit like Val√©rian, Sillage, Stargate, Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, The Visitors, and Alice in Wonderland, all rolled into one game across multiple universes.

#### Very Special Agents
So rare in the known universe that they are considered in many places as a pure legend (if one has heard of them), the Galactic Messengers belong to a separate order. Your character will have an ungrateful status among them: their behavior as an agent sent to the four corners of the cosmos, and even into other dimensions, will also serve to set an example of how humans from our Earth act. Speaking of Earth, the sages of the Galactic Assembly wonder: will it ever be admitted into the Assembly? Will it even be possible to reveal to Earthlings the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, and when? But how did this character, from a simple Earthling, become a member of the Guild of Megas?

#### Welcome to the Club
It should be known that the main link between the Megas is a power that they alone possess, the Transit: a trained Mega is capable of dematerializing in a tetrahedral structure and rematerializing near a similar structure, instantly, even at the other end of the universe or parallel universes. When you know that even the fastest spaceships take months, sometimes years, to reach their destination, this Transit capability is a powerful asset that the Guild plays with firm diplomacy. This power appears randomly in certain individuals, most often humanoids, on various planets, including Earth. In the case that concerns us, Galactic Messengers residing on our planet relentlessly seek to detect the "latent Megas" there, in order to reveal their power to them and recruit them into the ranks of the Guild.

#### Messengers of the Intercontinuum
During their training, Earthly Megas will discover how rich the universe is in surprises. They will acclimate to other planets, other gravities, meet extraterrestrials, learn to use antigravity barges, paralyzers, mediblocks, or various robots. They will also cultivate their Transit power to travel safely by this means, as well as another paired power: Transfer, which allows the mind to insinuate itself into the body of another living being. At the same time, their instructors will train them in the spirit of the Guild, a moral code flexible on some points but unyielding on others. If the rarity of individuals possessing Megas powers pushes the Guild to entrust less reliable agents with lesser missions, it is out of the question to develop these capabilities in potentially dangerous subjects! Once trained, some agents will resume their lives on Earth, ready to be absent for "business trips." Others will become "spacers" and never set foot on their native soil again, sometimes acting openly as agents of the Galactic Messengers Guild, or under various covers such as traffickers, sensoreporters, ambassadors... Finally, and above all, the Megas will be sent to other dimensions, to parallel lands almost identical to ours, or to what it was in the past, where they will be best placed to know how to act.
